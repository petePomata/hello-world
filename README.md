# hello-world

Greetings Fellow Developers,

I am a developer in the larval stages of my coding journey. I hope to one day morph into a beautiful code monkey, so I'm working hard to learn tools of my new trade, such as Git and Github. I now know how import it is to control my versions, as too many versions of me might become confusing.

Thanks for your interest and well wishes!
